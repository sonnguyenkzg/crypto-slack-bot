# Security Best Practices

Key security measures implemented in the USDT wallet monitoring bot.

## Access Control

**User Authorization**
- Only specific Slack user IDs can execute commands
- Different user lists for production and development environments
- All unauthorized attempts are logged and rejected

**Bot Permissions**
- Limited to `chat:write` and `app_mentions:read` only
- Cannot modify workspace settings or access other channels
- Read-only access to wallet balances via public APIs

## Credential Management

**Secure Storage**
- Production credentials stored in `/opt/usdt-bot-secrets/config`
- Protected by file system permissions and sudo access
- Automatic loading during bot startup
- No credentials stored in code or `.env` files in production

**Environment Separation**
- Production and development use separate credential systems
- Environment detection prevents credential mixing
- Fallback mechanisms for development environments

## Data Protection

**Wallet Information**
- Only public wallet addresses stored, no private keys
- Read-only blockchain queries, no transaction capabilities
- Address truncation in logs for privacy
- Historical balance data stored locally in CSV format

**Process Security**
- Single instance enforcement prevents conflicts
- Dedicated virtual environment isolation
- Proper cleanup on shutdown
- Process monitoring capabilities

## Operational Security

**Monitoring**
- All commands logged with user identification
- Security events tracked and auditable
- Process health monitoring
- Error logging without credential exposure

**Deployment**
- Automated startup script with safety checks
- File permission validation
- Service isolation
- Controlled restart procedures

## Key Security Points

- Bot cannot spend or transfer funds from wallets
- All sensitive credentials protected by system-level security
- User access controlled through Slack ID whitelist
- Complete audit trail of all bot interactions
- Read-only operations minimize attack surface
